I was recently asked by the President of my flying club on whether I’d like to be a “member-at-large” with the club. The basic premise being that it’s the lowest-tiered board member position of a non-profit flying organization. I thought it’d be an excellent opportunity to dive into learning how these types of organizations function, and, if in the future I’d like to upgrade my position to something higher in the club, I’d have an easy foot in. 

One of the most significant topics up for discussion in 2018 will certainly be acquiring a fourth airplane. We’ve reached a certain level of capacity with the current three airplanes we have, which leaves a question concerning what type of aircraft will the fourth one be! Members of the club are adamantly split on what to decide to buy, there are members who prefer another boring Cessna 172S, members who’d like something to haul their entire family over quite a bit of land (Piper Dakota or so), and another group of members who’d prefer something versatile, economical, sleek and shiny, something like perhaps a Diamond DA-40. My opinions rest with the third aircraft, a Diamond aircraft.

Not only are these aircraft incredibly cool looking, but they are very economical and come with a plethora of technological advancements. They are built in Europe and, have a superb glide ratio which is no doubt influenced by the great glider-type activities that occur in Europe. A comparison of a Cessna vs. a Diamond would no doubt leave the Cessna way behind, in my opinion. Truth be told, I haven’t flown one of these aircraft yet (haven’t had an opportunity to), but I don’t have a doubt in my mind that it would be a good experience. I’ve heard enough from people around me. It would be a great fit into the club. Reasonable costs, reasonable range, payload, speed, etc. What more could you expect when facing the necessity to please as many people as possible?
