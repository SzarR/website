Welcome!

With this website, I intend to document my struggles, challenges, and fortitude in pursuing my private pilot license (PPL) in the Chicagoland area. I’m currently in the preliminary stages of seeking approval for my special issuance FAA medical certificate. I hope to be in possession of a third class medical certificate by the middle of March. Afterward, I’ll be able to start my flight training and begin regularly updating this blog!
