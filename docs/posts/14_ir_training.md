As the year 2016 draws to a close, my sights are set on developing a schedule to master some of the more difficult concepts relating to instrument training in the year 2017. As my funds are a bit limited to dive head first into IR training, I’d first like to complete all the mandatory hour requirements by taking up close friends to share in the thrill of flying. I’m scouring the area for some interesting airports to fly into while meeting those requirements for my IR.

In terms of the self-edification process I’d like to establish, it would at least include a very detailed analysis and study of all instrument related concepts, particularly instrument related approaches, departures, arrivals, and an in depth understanding of the capabilities and limitations of air traffic control. I find that to be the “procedural” essence of an IR.

The tangible essence of an IR is the ability to fly the airplane in a plethora of weather related phenomena including clouds, fog, mist, and turbulent type weather. More night flights are also required to better relate and grasp how the body deals with night flights and fatigue.

I find that I typically learn best under the circumstances where I am given free reign to mold my own educational curricula. I take pride in diving underneath the superficial to better understand the essence of why things are developed the way they are.

Due to my wedding, the latter half of 2016 was not as successful as I would have liked it to be. I intend to capitalize on that by flying from 3/2017 – 10/2017.
