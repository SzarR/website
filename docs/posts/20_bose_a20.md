I’m ecstatic to report that I’ve received the Bose A20 headset with Bluetooth for Christmas this year. Initially, I would have never planned to spend (or let someone spend) so much money on a headset – because, well, that money could have been used on flying hours. Additionally, this particular headset has been on the market for quite a while. Bose however, have not revealed any plans concerning the next iteration of their infamous A20 headset. Reviews have been nearly universally positive about this headset though, so even if a new headset would be released, who knows how it would be received by the community? I decided to pull the trigger on the A20 headset for these reasons and ordered them from Sporty’s in order to save on shipping costs and leverage the no-tax benefit, which would have been +$100 dollars at an absolute minimum in this case.

Also, since I plan to pursue the rest of my licenses eventually, then I might as well save some of my hearing and invest the cost into a good headset at the outset. In other words, it really made sense to make this large purchase.

I haven’t had time to actually fly with the new headset yet, as the weather in the midwest has been anything but great. We have a lingering high pressure area that has brought with it some very cold temperatures – and I’m not terribly motivated to get out there in these very low temperatures. Just from a safety perspective – any off landing airport could be exponentially complicated with the cold weather.

The headset itself appears to be built very sturdy, and sits great on my head. Just listening to music from my Iphone via the bluetooth connection sounded excellent. The music sounds really crisp and clear. I can only imagine ATC communication will be similarly excellent. I’ll update once again after I’ve had a chance to take them up for a flight.
