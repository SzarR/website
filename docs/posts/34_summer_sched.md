I’ve been able to do quite a bit of flying this year for a change. I have logged three particularly fun flights in the last several weeks:

- On 9/7/20, Tomasz invited me to fly with him to Poplar Grove, to visit and relate to some of the history of the airport, but also, to fly a yellow 1946 Piper Cub with him! It was exhilarating, to fly an airplane with no electrical system and a couple of gauges and a stick. He let me have the airplane and control for at least thirty minutes, unloggable of course, as I do not have my tail wheel endorsement. This was probably the most fun flight I have had all year long.
- Second flight was my first actual IMC/IFR flight with Terry. We filed DPA-DKB-DPA. Terry flew the DPA-DKB leg, and I flew back, the DKB-DPA leg. We were straight IMC the whole way through, and I was given the ILS 02L approach into DPA. I did a great job, with just some work I’ll need to focus on in the future to correct my heading corrections when flying a cross-wind, as I was swinging wildly on the localizer for the approach. My vertical guidance however was spot on.
- My last flight was with Gary, to get my checkout (finally) in the SR-20. It worked out great and I was checked out after only a single flight! I have already made plans to take a few friends on 10/8/20 for a trip.
