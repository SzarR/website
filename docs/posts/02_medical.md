In 2005 I was diagnosed with a “severe coarctation of aorta,” which, in aviation terminology, is considered an ineligible condition for medical certification. 14 CFR 67 outlines the conditions of medical certification under the FAA. the part that specifically applies to my condition is found in .113, .213 and .313. Nevertheless, I was not deterred and submitted the history of my diagnosis to the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) for an individual review of my case and determination based on the evidence I provided. My results were fruitful and I was granted authorization for special issuance of a medical certificate under Title 14 of the CFR’s Section 67.401. I am now required to annually submit a wellness report by my treating cardiologist, outlining my treatment plan and medications, in addition to any adverse symptoms I may be experiencing. I should also include a copy of a recent 2D M-mode echocardiogram.

Basically, I’m under a watchful eye by the FAA, and I absolutely must report any adverse conditions as stated in 14 CFR 61.53. It is primarily because of this watchful eye that makes it difficult to invest my desire to pursue flying as a career. I’m a pessimist to the extent that I wouldn’t know what to do with myself should my certification lapse. I’m certainly confident in my own health, but a coarctation of aorta is considered a serious type of congenital heart disease. I stay fit and eat healthy, in order to try to the best of my abilities, to make up for the years lost to abnormally high blood pressure.

I was at the AME last Tuesday, and I passed the 3rd class examination with no issues. I performed better than expected at the eye exam, too. I’m now waiting for my certificate to arrive in the mail, so that I can resume flying at the club. My last logged flight was 12/7! I’m eager to knock out the next portion of my PPL training (solo cross-country flights) and then train for the check ride. I’m getting closer.
