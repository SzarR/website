Reading an interesting book over the weekend titled “The Checklist Manifesto,” I felt compelled to create a blog post to solidify my understanding of the entire checklist process, in addition to providing the readers of this blog with a concept of the idea as well. As Mr. Gawande presents in his book, checklists are designed to catch, and minimize errors. They offload those cognitive tasks that require cognition to complete in order for the mind to help focus on the more important aspects pertaining to your flight. By “offloading” certain critical items onto a paper, the brain is freeing up precision working memory to contribute to other, high demanding tasks.

The other aspect of the checklist helps inculcate a certain level of automation, that maximizes our chances of achieving a successful outcome if we follow the checklist through its completion. For example, an engine out scenario has an associated checklist with it, and during high times of stress, these checklists will help the pilot not forget key pieces of information if they are so pre-occupied with the engine out scenario. Checklists are precious items, and they foster a certain level of discipline when you follow them before each takeoff and landing. Sure, statistics speak to your advantage; a probability of incurring engine failure on takeoff is probably low, but nevertheless, possessing the discipline to nevertheless expect the unexpected and follow a checklist through its completion is a glowing sign of a competent aviator.

Mr. Gawande presents an interesting Chapter 6, where he discusses a meeting with a Boeing executive that is responsible for the development and execution of checklists on commercial aircraft such as the beloved B777 and B787. One glaring take-away from this chapter is the amount of time and effort involved to maximize the usability of the checklist in a dynamic, changing environment, while adhering to the limitations of time and wordiness. Checklists should be concise and minimalistic in nature, while capturing the essence of the scenario effectively. Make them too long, and crews will drag to complete them. Make them too short and crews will be left with missing bits of potentially key information.
