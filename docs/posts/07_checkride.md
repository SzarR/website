It’s been a long journey, and a portion of it was left undocumented in this blog, contrary to my original inclinations. Nevertheless, I am preparing myself for the final stage in obtaining my Private Pilot Certificate, ASEL. This encompasses the dual oral and practical flight portion, which will be occurring only days away, on September 23rd in KJVL.

I’m running through my final preparations and meticulously planning all elements of the flight including the plan for an alternate form of action, should that engine failure ever occur. Staying one step ahead of the aircraft is the name of the game in aviation.

I’ve also been a bit shy posting in this blog since the tragic accident of N62681 – my former 172P training aircraft. Since then, I’ve moved on and into the 172SP, a very  nice upgrade with a ton of fancy gadgets.

Nevertheless, I do fully intend to document scenic flights I will be taking with the long slew of applicants who are willing and able to go up flying with me after I obtain my wings. It should be fun to see how my friends and colleagues react to sitting behind the control column of a single engine aircraft. Perhaps some of them will too, become inspired to chase their own set of wings?
