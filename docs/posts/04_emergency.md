If emergency strikes during your next flight, will you be ready to act efficiently? As a student pilot working toward my PPL this year, I have treated emergency procedures as a pivotal cornerstone of my flight training. For me, the thought of an emergency happens fairly regularly, and because of it, I am able to plan accordingly. A once famous quote states: “A pilot can be disappointed, but should never be surprised.” Taxi and takeoff briefings are instrumental toward the success of encountering an engine-out scenario after takeoff. Referencing current aerodome charts, minimum turn back altitudes, and suitable alternative landing scenarios should all be briefed. Taking it a step further, a glance through the emergency procedures chapter in my Cessna 172P Information Manual, Section 3, outlines a plethora of quick-action checklists available for utilization. As far as these checklists are concerned, these must be ingrained in the memory of a serious aviator because time will not be on your side.

What are some of these procedures for encountering emergencies when the engine is turning? I have outlined a select few below:

Engine Failure during takeoff roll

    Throttle — IDLE.
    Brakes — APPLY.
    Wing Flaps — RETRACT.
    Mixture — IDLE CUT-OFF.
    Ignition Switch — OFF.
    Master Switch — OFF.

Engine Failure immediately after takeoff

    Airspeed — 65 KIAS (flaps UP) 60 KIAS (flaps DOWN).
    Mixture — IDLE CUT-OFF.
    Fuel Selector Valve — PUSH DOWN AND ROTATE TO OFF.
    Ignition Switch — OFF.
    Wing Flaps — AS REQUIRED.
    Master Switch — OFF.

Engine failure during flight (Restart procedures)

    Airspeed — 65 KIAS.
    Carburetor Heat — ON.
    Fuel Selector Valve — BOTH.
    Mixture — RICH.
    Ignition Switch — BOTH (or Start if propeller is stopped).
    Primer — IN and LOCKED.

In reference to my previous posting about the Checklist Manifesto book, checklists should be short enough to remember and utilize. They should not be the length of the book. They should focus on the essential aspects of the aircraft, which primarily deal with the engine and fuel. Troubleshooting a failed engine after takeoff is a risky maneuver, which is why the second checklist deals primarily with securing the aircraft for impact. The third checklist assumes the power loss occurs at cruise level, which typically affords the pilot a few minutes of valuable time to troubleshoot the scenario.

Remember, on the 172P, the lift-to-drag ratio on the 172P is approximately 9 to 1, which means for every 1,000 feet down, the aircraft is able to travel 9,000 feet. In order to maximize the LD ratio, use the manufacturer’s recommended airspeed of 65 KIAS.
