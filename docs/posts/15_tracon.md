My monthly flying club meeting hosted a very informative Q&A session with an FAA controller this evening. Among some of the topics we discussed included:

    TCAS RESOLUTION Scenarios
    VFR Corridors including the “Eisenhower Transition”
    Different frequencies / calling up procedure terminology

Some of the interesting things I learned included the checking in procedure, and how simple it must be in the beginning. ACID, VFR Request. In other words, Archer 41598, VFR request. First however, you must monitor the frequency in order not to step on another pilot’s transmission. It may seem that the frequency is quiet but, in actuality, the controller may be simultaneously communicating on multiple frequencies. It’s not always clear whether the controller is busy or not, therefore, one can easily query the controller concerning how busy operations currently are. Important ORD frequencies for Flight Following include:

    North Satellite: 120.55
    Southeast Satellite: 128.20
    South Satellite: 119.35
    Southwest Satellite: 133.50

Another interesting snippet is that the approach controller may sometimes clear you through the Class D, such as Gary Airspace, but not always so. This most certainly depends upon whether Gary Airspace is experiencing any inbound/outbound traffic and would preferably like to talk with the pilot directly. If operations are otherwise quiet however, Gary may just allow Chicago Approach to continue to control me.

When instrument training, it is mandatory to request it and receive approval from ATC, per AIM paragraph 4-3-21-E.

Not much was touched upon TFRs, which always will remain a grey area for me to discuss.

Another aspect I forgot to mention is the corridor along Lake Shore Drive. The controller recommended a maximum of 2,000 feet MSL to not become an issue for landing traffic at MDW when the 22’s are active. This point will help ensure I always remain at approximately 1,800 MSL or so around this sector of the scenic flight.

Finally, part of the presentation touched upon the famous “Eisenhower Transition” where a pilot flies west/east bound along I290 at approximately 1,700 feet MSL in order to “cut through” below the Class Bravo airspace and just 0.5 NM north of the Class Charlie. However, with such a low altitude, I have serious hesitations for performing this maneuver with passengers on board. Perhaps my mind will change on this if I one day fly the transition with another pilot.
