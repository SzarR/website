I’m beginning to closely study the POH for the Piper Archer III aircraft that is available at my club to rent. I’ll be developing two additional aids: a quick reference guide specifying weights, speeds, and limitations of the aircraft in addition to takeoff and landing briefings where I can incorporate and begin to memorize new “flow” patterns.

The Archer III is additionally fitted with an Aspen MFD. I’ll need to study up on the features of all the technology that is jammed into that aircraft as my intention will be to do some cross country flying with it over the next couple of years.

Finally, I’ve also went ahead and purchased ForeFlight, which is jam packed with so many useful features. I’m excited to begin wrapping my head around all these new inbound changes!
