Nevertheless, I was not deterred and submitted the history of my diagnosis to the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) for an individual review of my case and determination based on the evidence I provided. My results were fruitful and I was granted authorization for special issuance of a medical certificate under Title 14 of the CFR\u2019s Section 67.401. I am now required to annually submit a wellness report by my treating cardiologist, outlining my treatment plan and medications, in addition to any adverse symptoms I may be experiencing. I should also include a copy of a recent 2D M-mode echocardiogram.</p> <p>Basically, I\u2019m under a watchful eye by the FAA, and I absolutely must report any adverse conditions as stated in 14 CFR 61.53. It is primarily because of this watchful eye that makes it difficult to invest my desire to pursue flying as a career. I\u2019m a pessimist to the extent that I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself should my certification lapse. I\u2019m certainly confident in my own health, but a coarctation of aorta is considered a serious type of congenital heart disease. I stay fit and eat healthy, in order to try to the best of my abilities, to make up for the years lost to abnormally high blood pressure.</p> <p>I was at the AME last Tuesday, and I passed the 3rd class examination with no issues.

I\u2019m getting closer.</p>"},{"location":"posts/03_checklists/","title":"Checklists","text":"<p>Reading an interesting book over the weekend titled \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto,\u201d I felt compelled to create a blog post to solidify my understanding of the entire checklist process, in addition to providing the readers of this blog with a concept of the idea as well. As Mr. Gawande presents in his book, checklists are designed to catch, and minimize errors. They offload those cognitive tasks that require cognition to complete in order for the mind to help focus on the more important aspects pertaining to your flight. By \u201coffloading\u201d certain critical items onto a paper, the brain is freeing up precision working memory to contribute to other, high demanding tasks.</p> <p>The other aspect of the checklist helps inculcate a certain level of automation, that maximizes our chances of achieving a successful outcome if we follow the checklist through its completion. For example, an engine out scenario has an associated checklist with it, and during high times of stress, these checklists will help the pilot not forget key pieces of information if they are so pre-occupied with the engine out scenario. Checklists are precious items, and they foster a certain level of discipline when you follow them before each takeoff and landing. Sure, statistics speak to your advantage; a probability of incurring engine failure on takeoff is probably low, but nevertheless, possessing the discipline to nevertheless expect the unexpected and follow a checklist through its completion is a glowing sign of a competent aviator.</p> <p>Mr. Gawande presents an interesting Chapter 6, where he discusses a meeting with a Boeing executive that is responsible for the development and execution of checklists on commercial aircraft such as the beloved B777 and B787. One glaring take-away from this chapter is the amount of time and effort involved to maximize the usability of the checklist in a dynamic, changing environment, while adhering to the limitations of time and wordiness. Checklists should be concise and minimalistic in nature, while capturing the essence of the scenario effectively. Make them too long, and crews will drag to complete them. Make them too short and crews will be left with missing bits of potentially key information.</p>"},{"location":"posts/04_emergency/","title":"Emergencies","text":"<p>If emergency strikes during your next flight, will you be ready to act efficiently? As a student pilot working toward my PPL this year, I have treated emergency procedures as a pivotal cornerstone of my flight training. For me, the thought of an emergency happens fairly regularly, and because of it, I am able to plan accordingly. A once famous quote states: \u201cA pilot can be disappointed, but should never be surprised.\u201d Taxi and takeoff briefings are instrumental toward the success of encountering an engine-out scenario after takeoff. Referencing current aerodome charts, minimum turn back altitudes, and suitable alternative landing scenarios should all be briefed. Taking it a step further, a glance through the emergency procedures chapter in my Cessna 172P Information Manual, Section 3, outlines a plethora of quick-action checklists available for utilization. As far as these checklists are concerned, these must be ingrained in the memory of a serious aviator because time will not be on your side.</p> <p>What are some of these procedures for encountering emergencies when the engine is turning? I have outlined a select few below:</p> <p>Engine Failure during takeoff roll</p> <pre><code>Throttle \u2014 IDLE.\nBrakes \u2014 APPLY.\nWing Flaps \u2014 RETRACT.\nMixture \u2014 IDLE CUT-OFF.\nIgnition Switch \u2014 OFF.\nMaster Switch \u2014 OFF.\n</code></pre> <p>Engine Failure immediately after takeoff</p> <pre><code>Airspeed \u2014 65 KIAS (flaps UP) 60 KIAS (flaps DOWN).\nMixture \u2014 IDLE CUT-OFF.\nFuel Selector Valve \u2014 PUSH DOWN AND ROTATE TO OFF.\nIgnition Switch \u2014 OFF.\nWing Flaps \u2014 AS REQUIRED.\nMaster Switch \u2014 OFF.\n</code></pre> <p>Engine failure during flight (Restart procedures)</p> <pre><code>Airspeed \u2014 65 KIAS.\nCarburetor Heat \u2014 ON.\nFuel Selector Valve \u2014 BOTH.\nMixture \u2014 RICH.\nIgnition Switch \u2014 BOTH (or Start if propeller is stopped).\nPrimer \u2014 IN and LOCKED.\n</code></pre> <p>In reference to my previous posting about the Checklist Manifesto book, checklists should be short enough to remember and utilize. They should not be the length of the book. They should focus on the essential aspects of the aircraft, which primarily deal with the engine and fuel. Troubleshooting a failed engine after takeoff is a risky maneuver, which is why the second checklist deals primarily with securing the aircraft for impact. The third checklist assumes the power loss occurs at cruise level, which typically affords the pilot a few minutes of valuable time to troubleshoot the scenario.</p> <p>Remember, on the 172P, the lift-to-drag ratio on the 172P is approximately 9 to 1, which means for every 1,000 feet down, the aircraft is able to travel 9,000 feet. In order to maximize the LD ratio, use the manufacturer\u2019s recommended airspeed of 65 KIAS.</p>"},{"location":"posts/05_back/","title":"Back in the Air","text":"<p>It felt great to be back in the air with my instructor \u2013 getting my proficiency levels back into check so that I can knock out the remaining stages of my PPL. In case you were wondering, I haven\u2019t been up in the air since 12/7, where I completed a refresher flight in anticipation for my XC flights. Unfortunately, the winter was rough and many trips were cancelled at the last minute, As more and more flights were cancelled, my proficiency levels depleted and I lost the confidence I so greatly need to succeed when up in the air.</p> <p>Additionally, in March my medical certification lapsed and I had to deal with Oklahoma City for renewal. This took approximately 4 weeks longer than anticipated, which left me for a period of time unable to fly at all. When my medical certificate finally arrived, the validity period increased from 12 months to three years, a big and happy surprise.</p> <p>My 4/12 flight began with a weather check. Visibility and cloud clearance standards were not going to be an issue. We were departing DPA, a Class D airport where minimum criteria is \u2013 3 Statute Miles visibility, 500 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 2,000 feet horizontal separation from visible clouds. Our enroute phase of flight to DKB (our training field) would consistent of transgressing predominantly Class E airspace, where the limits are, when below 10,000 MSL and during daytime: 3 Statute miles visibility, 500 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 2,000 feet horizontal separation from any visible clouds.</p> <p>The winds however, were gusting; 190 / 17, G23. This made me naturally a bit nervous but as soon as I jumped into the A/C of choice \u2013 a 1986 Cessna 172P with registration N62681, I felt right at home. I reviewed the technical log book and the only squawk was a possible taxi-light issue, which during the day, did not pose any issues. I briefed for a 20R departure with a turn to 270 at approximately 1,500 MSL. I set the radios, obtained takeoff clearance, and was on my way. Climb out was uneventful. Because of the winds, I elected not to rotate at 55 IAS but rather at approximately 62 IAS, with a more firm and aggressive rotation. This was not to be caught in any downdraft or wind shift while on the takeoff roll. Since the winds were aligned with the runway, correction was not necessary.</p> <p>Next time on departure, I need to ensure I maintain the runway heading and not deviate into the takeoff path of 20L aircraft. This could potentially be a hazardous situation if gone unnoticed. We climbed uneventfully to 3,000 feet, where I established cruise power and leaned the mixture accordingly. Brad wanted to practice some air-work at altitude, and the first was the infamous power-off stall. GMC, then throttle 1,700 RPM, first notch of flaps, followed by full flaps, power idle, pull up until you hear the stall horn, feel buffeting and general poor responsiveness from the controls, until the airplane breaks and pitches down. At that point, Carb heat \u2013 COLD, power full, level off and then establish slow climb, and retract flaps as necessary. This procedure must be ingrained into the pilots habitual action plan.</p> <p>The next procedure were steep turns. For steep turns, first one must establish a safe perimter through clearing turns and scanning for traffic. Second step would be to establish Va of 99 IAS, and finally entering the turn one will require a bit additional power. Maintaining the turn is rather simple, and requires constant control back pressure. My steep turn to the left was great, and to the right I suffered a loss of approximately 10 IAS and 200 Feet. I need to work on my right steep turns before my practical test.</p> <p>Cross-wind landings at DKB were next on the agenda. My first landing was terrible. My second and third however were good. I am slowly beginning to understand the concept of low-wing, and opposite rudder to counteract the adverse effect of a strong cross-wind. The procedure must be ingrained into my skill set through constant practice and repetition.</p> <p>After our stint at DKB, we departed again to the west to investigate the Fairdale, IL EF-4 tornado that pounded the area just days before my flight. You could see the path of the tornado through the corn fields, and as it eventually came right through the small town.</p>"},{"location":"posts/06_flying_pause/","title":"Flying after a Pause","text":"<p>I finally was able to plan and go fly again after my first XC trip that I took in April. Shortly thereafter, I went on a trip to Thailand for two weeks, and after coming back from that it\u2019s been quite hectic at work. Enough of the excuses however, I should have been flying more because the skill of my landings seems to have deteriorated.</p> <p>The weather was reasonable \u2013 10SM visibility, clear skies under 18,000 feet with QNH2993, winds CALM / VAR / 200/05. Information was Tango as I called up DPA Ground on 120.8 for taxi clearance to remain in the pattern \u2013 I was given a LH pattern for 20L after my departure from 20R. The take-off was uneventful, rotation at 55 KIAS, and a strong climb out to pattern altitude at 1,590. My first landing was awful however and resulted in a go around after I seem to have bounced and landed on an angle. As the plane came in for the approach, I was properly configured at FULL flaps and 65 KIAS. I pulled power at the numbers but it seems like I still had a ton of energy to dispose of \u2013 and the landing gear ended up taking the blunt of the impact and forced me back into the air. My instincts to initiate a go around shortly thereafter were great however. I applied full power, carb heat COLD, flew at level altitude for about 20 seconds to build up airspeed, and began to retract the flaps. I\u2019ve got my go around technique solidified.</p> <p>I came in for my second approach on 20L with the same issue as before. The aircraft didn\u2019t seem to be level when I touched down, and the nose wheel came down too quickly. I felt like the aircraft was in a sense hydroplaning and I was not in control.</p> <p>After a few more approaches and go-arounds, I have lost my faith in landing in calm wind conditions. What the heck is going on? I sat down with my instructor to talk about it. When you think about it, during a calm wind day, the aircraft is travelling faster than when you are flying into a head wind. All this excess speed means that the flare needs to come at a later point, since you will have a lot of excess speed to shed before you are ready to touch down.</p> <p>I need to do some more research and more importantly \u2013 go up with my instructor to solidify my confidence in my skills once again.

I had made sure no stone was left un-turned when it came to my preparations. I meticulously crafted a PDF briefing sourced from DUATS with all current weather at the departure, destination and alternate fields. Additionally, I had included NOTAMS, FD Winds Aloft, FA forecasts, and any other pertinent information necessary to completing a safe flight. At the end of the document, I included all relevant and valid weather charts including radar summary charts, prognostic charts, surface weather charts, sig WX charts and satellite pictures. I handed the packet over to the DPE and he asked me a lot of questions about the charts in particular. I walked him through a majority of them and I believe he was satisfied with my level of detail in planning the flight.</p> <p>Afterward we chatted about FARs, hypothetical scenarios and a lot of discussion concerning inoperative equipment.</p> <p>The actual checkride portion of the test was a lot of fun, to say the least. The highlight was the simulated engine out procedure. He cut power at 4,500 and I executed 3 360 turns to a grass field landing he suggested I try. The runway there was 9/27, and winds were 160/07. The runway was 2400 feet long by 155 feet, at C37. I executed the procedure brilliantly and landed on the grass strip and brought the plane to a stop, taxiied back and took off again.</p> <p>Other aspects of the checkride included some turns around a point, power-on and power-off stalls, steep turns, slow flight, short field landings and soft-field takeoffs.</p> <p>At the end, he didn\u2019t have much to say except that I taxied too fast at JVL.

The checkride process is approximately a 1.5 hour ride where I demonstrate my familiarity and competence in the aircraft, mostly related to emergency procedures.

I\u2019ve always wanted to fly this plane even before I was in possession of my PPL. The price point for the rental is more expensive however, ~ $25 per hour. Also, the low wing may prove problematic for all the sight seeing flights I will be taking with my friends. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the investment at this point, though getting some experience in low-wing aircraft would surely be nice to have and diversifying my portfolio of aircraft I am comfortable to PIC would be nice.

Now I have nothing against Cessna nor am I bashing the 152/172 series aircraft, but I have felt an urgent desire to shift to low-wing aircraft over the last couple of months. All my previously logged hours will no doubt serve to make me a competent pilot in my future role of flying predominantly Piper aircraft (I hope).</p> <p>The weather cooled down significantly from yesterday here at DPA, with an OAT of 77F and a solid BKN200 layer overshadowing the field. My preflight inspection was as thorough as it was ever going to be, as I began to understand the design of Piper Cherokee aircraft. Three fuel drains, manually activated flaps (which in my opinion is the most funky thing I have had to deal with during the transition) and keeping in mind to monitor fuel tanks and run the fuel pumps at specified times during your flight.</p> <p>Takeoff was normal, though it felt more heavier and reluctant to leave the ground. It finally did, and we climbed out a little faster than Best Climb, which is 76 KIAS in this aircraft. We made our way to the NW of the field to practice some slow flight, power off stalls, and emergency descents.

Among some of the topics we discussed included:</p> <pre><code>TCAS RESOLUTION Scenarios\nVFR Corridors including the \u201cEisenhower Transition\u201d\nDifferent frequencies / calling up procedure terminology\n</code></pre> <p>Some of the interesting things I learned included the checking in procedure, and how simple it must be in the beginning. ACID, VFR Request. In other words, Archer 41598, VFR request. First however, you must monitor the frequency in order not to step on another pilot\u2019s transmission. It may seem that the frequency is quiet but, in actuality, the controller may be simultaneously communicating on multiple frequencies. It\u2019s not always clear whether the controller is busy or not, therefore, one can easily query the controller concerning how busy operations currently are. Important ORD frequencies for Flight Following include:</p> <pre><code>North Satellite: 120.55\nSoutheast Satellite: 128.20\nSouth Satellite: 119.35\nSouthwest Satellite: 133.50\n</code></pre> <p>Another interesting snippet is that the approach controller may sometimes clear you through the Class D, such as Gary Airspace, but not always so. This most certainly depends upon whether Gary Airspace is experiencing any inbound/outbound traffic and would preferably like to talk with the pilot directly. If operations are otherwise quiet however, Gary may just allow Chicago Approach to continue to control me.</p> <p>When instrument training, it is mandatory to request it and receive approval from ATC, per AIM paragraph 4-3-21-E.</p> <p>Not much was touched upon TFRs, which always will remain a grey area for me to discuss.</p> <p>Another aspect I forgot to mention is the corridor along Lake Shore Drive. The controller recommended a maximum of 2,000 feet MSL to not become an issue for landing traffic at MDW when the 22\u2019s are active. This point will help ensure I always remain at approximately 1,800 MSL or so around this sector of the scenic flight.</p> <p>Finally, part of the presentation touched upon the famous \u201cEisenhower Transition\u201d where a pilot flies west/east bound along I290 at approximately 1,700 feet MSL in order to \u201ccut through\u201d below the Class Bravo airspace and just 0.5 NM north of the Class Charlie. However, with such a low altitude, I have serious hesitations for performing this maneuver with passengers on board. Perhaps my mind will change on this if I one day fly the transition with another pilot.</p>"},{"location":"posts/16_spring_xride_17/","title":"Spring Checkride 2017","text":"<p>The weather was a little cooler than I would have anticipated \u2013 I finally got to see how the ground plug unit works to keep the engine warm in the colder months.

I proposed the idea for a night flight to him because I know the weather to be much calmer at night, especially the winds and the resultant turbulence associated with those winds. We planned for a take-off (TOT) time of around 19:00. The plan was to climb to 3,000 and fly a northerly heading toward BUU and then turn northeast toward RAC. It was my intention to perform a full stop landing at RAC to be able to count the entirety of the trip toward my XC time. In fact, I was able to log XC, PIC, and NIGHT time with this trip, which was really helpful to build hours toward the instrument rating.</p> <p>After the landing and taxi-back at RAC, we immediately departed to the south \u2013 taking care of the operating Class D airspaces (UGN &amp; ENW) that we had to cross in order to take the scenic downtown Chicago flight. As always, Chicago Approach was very hepful in dissemanting flight following for our Piper aircraft. We were able to avoid a helicopter flying at a similar altitude as us thanks to the GNS430 TCAS and FF. The views were breathtaking. The sky was clear, the winds were calm and the turbulence was non-existent. The only thing left was to enjoy the beautiful views that were before our eyes. The city is so vibrant and golden at night \u2013 so peaceful flying above it.

Initially, I would have never planned to spend (or let someone spend) so much money on a headset \u2013 because, well, that money could have been used on flying hours. Additionally, this particular headset has been on the market for quite a while. Bose however, have not revealed any plans concerning the next iteration of their infamous A20 headset. Reviews have been nearly universally positive about this headset though, so even if a new headset would be released, who knows how it would be received by the community? I decided to pull the trigger on the A20 headset for these reasons and ordered them from Sporty\u2019s in order to save on shipping costs and leverage the no-tax benefit, which would have been +$100 dollars at an absolute minimum in this case.</p> <p>Also, since I plan to pursue the rest of my licenses eventually, then I might as well save some of my hearing and invest the cost into a good headset at the outset. In other words, it really made sense to make this large purchase.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had time to actually fly with the new headset yet, as the weather in the midwest has been anything but great. We have a lingering high pressure area that has brought with it some very cold temperatures \u2013 and I\u2019m not terribly motivated to get out there in these very low temperatures. Just from a safety perspective \u2013 any off landing airport could be exponentially complicated with the cold weather.</p> <p>The headset itself appears to be built very sturdy, and sits great on my head. Just listening to music from my Iphone via the bluetooth connection sounded excellent. The music sounds really crisp and clear. I can only imagine ATC communication will be similarly excellent.

There were approximately fifteen of us in the room. The meetings are typically held, once a month, on the first level of the DuPage Airport Terminal Building. It\u2019s a very nice building with all cutting edge technology like Wi-Fi, projectors, etc. The content of these meetings are pretty structured, with presentations concerning membership numbers, the finances of the club and how much money was spent on various expensive in the last month, and finally the maintenance department, with an outline on what sorts of issues were reported concerning any of our three aircraft, and steps taken to fix the identified problems. Also, discussion concerning Annual inspections, engine overhauls, and ADS-B installations are presented in this phase of the meeting as well.</p> <p>After all the mandatory meeting items were addressed,  a majority of the remainder of time was diverted to discussing the details and process of acquiring our fourth aircraft. As I may have eluded to in previous posts, our club is nearing the membership capacity for three aircraft. Our current membership size is 55 members. The maximum limit is 20 members per aircraft. We\u2019re 5 members away from capacity, and the bylaws state that over 60 members, we\u2019d be required to acquire a fourth airplane. Now there are many differing opinions concerning exactly what fourth airplane the club should acquire. I\u2019ve heard discussions concerning a Piper Dakota, RV-12, Diamond DA-40 or DA-20, or even another Archer III. As is to be expected, dissent is rampant.</p> <p>Our Club President performed some neat data analysis techniques to identify three \u201cgroups\u201d of members for focus group meetings. These three \u201cclusters\u201d partionined club members into the number of hours they have logged with the club in the last year. It\u2019s obvious to me that members who fly more hours in the club should have a more significant \u201csay\u201d in the type of aircraft we acquire, since a majority of the club\u2019s operating expenses are paid primarily by these high-hour flying members. It makes 0 sense to listen to someone who screams \u201cGET A CESSNA\u201d fifteen times at a club meeting, but has logged approximately 2 hours in any of the club aircraft over the last year! </p> <p>We intend to perform these small focus group meetings to identify the needs and requirements of our members, so as to better gauge what type of aircraft we should be focusing our attention on. Once we hold these focus group sessions with the three groups of members, we\u2019ll be able to re-convene and present the findings of these discussions. This should help us pave the way forward in determining the right aircraft for our club, while supporting the objectives of those club members who contribute the most to the sustenance of the flying club.</p> <p>On my second point of this posting, I\u2019d like to address my goals related to aviation in the year 2018:</p> <pre><code>Pass my Instrument Rating Written Test with a 90.00% or higher as a score. I plan to schedule this examination for May, 2018.\nComplete all my pre-requisite flying hours for the IR.\nTake 10 friends flying and introduce them to the joys of flying.\n</code></pre> <p>I admit that in 2017, I dropped the ball on flying. I only flew a total of approximately 13 hours. This year, I\u2019d like to fly at least 40 hours. That averages out to approximately four hours a month, which sounds completely attainable. I\u2019ve got a safety pilot friend who\u2019s interested in pairing up with me to do some flying, in order to build hours for his commercial license while I fly under the hood to obtain my XC and Simulated Instrument hours. The flying should be a lot smoother and quieter with the new Bose A20 headset I got for Christmas, which I wasn\u2019t yet able to try out because of this severe cold weather we have been having in the Midwest. As the Stoics would say though, \u201cthis too, shall pass\u201d and I\u2019ll be flying again in Mid-January.</p> <p>I\u2019ve scheduled the Archer III for several hours this coming Saturday morning. For now, forecasts are looking optimistic. It\u2019ll be my first solo winter flight, so I\u2019ll be extra careful concerning SOPs and probably more conservative in my go/no-go decision. </p>"},{"location":"posts/22_flying_back_seat/","title":"Flying from the back seat","text":"<p>Today was not your ordinary Saturday. In fact, it was far from it. The day began bright and early at 6:00 a.m., with a quick breakfast and pre-flight to leave and arrive at the airport by 0730. The plan was a solid morning of flying with my two friends Tomek and Irek. The weather was forecast to be clear but slightly cold; my suspicions were confirmed when my car indicated -5F OAT while en route to the airport. It was so cold that I thought twice about actually going through with the plan and flying. What would happen if the airplane would force us to make an unscheduled landing somewhere other than an airport, am I adequately equipped to brave the elements for an extended period of time? It may seem laughable, but there are areas in Illinois that are quite remote. Thinking these things through caused me to change my original plan of flying to BMI from DKB, into simply flying more in the general vicinity of the airport. The plan was to begin logging some simulated IFR time and working towards the requirements of the IR. </p> <p>As Tomek pulled up to the hangar, we quickly made our way to the aircraft to check on how everything was looking. Upon entering the hangar however, I noticed that the aircraft engine block heater electrical plug was hanging out of the wall socket. Touching the cowling of the Piper Archer confirmed my thoughts; the engine wasn\u2019t pre-heated. This fact, was, in essence the nail in the coffin for our flying plans for the day. We figured no chance that the O-360-A4M would ignite under these temperatures. Additionally, the aircraft was not flown for at least the last two weeks, adding to the fact that it\u2019s been sitting in the hangar for quite a few days with no use. Instead, we attempted to plug the aircraft into electrical in order to turn the GPS 430 and ASPEN E1000 on and get some ground training in the operation of these fantastic pieces of technology. This plan, however, was not completed because we ran out of electrical sockets in the hangar! We shut down and exited the hangar, in clear defeat.</p> <p>Upon leaving the airport, I noticed another club member getting ready to fly in the club\u2019s 172S aircraft. They volunteered for me to hitch a ride in the back seat. I agreed, at least I\u2019d get some sort of air time today, even if it meant not logging Simulated IFR, XC, nor PIC time. This particular club member was in the final stages of obtaining his instrument rating, so the trip would be a valuable glimpse into understanding and seeing IFR practice procedures in the real world. The trip commenced with a standard take off from 28 at KDPA, proceeding direct to join the RNAV approach at KDKB for RWY 20. It was amazing how fast the aircraft climbed and how little power was needed to keep a 172S at gross weight straight and level. At the MDA, the pilot executed the missed approach procedure and proceeded direct to the holding fix and executed some holds. It was very interesting to see. I understood the wind correction angles and the timing of the legs and standard rate turns, but, it was difficult for me to visualize the overall procedure. </p> <p>After the procedures at DKB were completed, we proceeded to shoot the VOR-A approach at C09, Morris. The approach is based from the JOT VOR, with a circling minimum published for the approach because the final approach course does not bring you directly in for a runway, but rather, into the airport environment. Once visual with the field, the expectation would be that the pilot would execute a circling maneuver for either of the runways. The last approach was the ILS 02L into DPA with Chicago Approach coordinating the entire procedure on 133.50. Very fun to listen to the pilot call and request the IFR procedure. Chicago Approach was very accommodating.

It\u2019s a free event that brings together around 300 pilots to participate in a series of various refresher courses with the subliminal purpose of getting us back into the groove of flying for the Spring. An added benefit to attending the event is the FAA wings credit that you are awarded with that can be used to achieve various objectives through the WINGS program. Sadly I don\u2019t know much more about this program, other than you receive various numbers of credit hours for continuing your aviation education. Our flying club had a booth set up where we discussed our club with potential prospects, and other vendors were present as well. These included the DKB and PWK airport authorities. </p> <p>The summit is split into three \u201ctracks\u201d, VFR, IFR, and \u201cFlying Companions \u2013 Aspiring Pilots\u201d. In years past, I would have been more inclined to sit in the VFR seminars \u2013 learning about topics such as turbulence, or, which GPS is best to pair with your IPad. But this year I was strongly inclined to attend discussions relating to IFR procedures. I\u2019ve really been debating how I\u2019d like to begin my IFR training, but I know that before any of that can begin, I will first need to accumulate the hours toward the rating \u2013 by logging Simulated IMC and XC time. I intend to do this with a lot of flying with friends.</p> <p>The first seminar was directly related to IFR procedures \u2013 providing a review of typical approaches you would see in addition to a  discussion of IFR symbology and holding procedures. Various procedures were analyzed including minimum altitudes, decision altitudes, ILS approaches, lighting, etc. The presenter didn\u2019t seem in absolute command of the material, and some aspects of the presentation were off putting (not answering the question that was asked seemed to be a recurring topic). Additionally, he had outdated charts he was referencing and when fellow pilots in the room pulled up the same approach in ForeFlight, they had a completely different depiction of the approach procedure! Nevertheless, I did gain some basic valuable insights into IFR flying that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise received, and so I am thankful for that. The pilot crowd was quite engaged in the material too, which I often find to be the case with GA pilots. There was a lot of productive dialogue related to the interpretation of approach charts.</p> <p>The second presentation which directly followed the first was a genuine pleasure to listen to. A DPE named Gail discussed her experiences related to check rides over the course of the last twenty years. She\u2019s been at it a while, and could first hand describe to you the changing nature of pilot training in our constantly technologically evolving society. Her biggest gripe though wasn\u2019t the magical EFB and general ignorance of building skills related to spatial orientation and IPads; her gripe was with aviators logging hours for ratings by performing \u201cshuttle\u201d runs between three or four of the same airports until enough hours have been accrued to apply for the next rating or license. This is not the definition of gaining experience, from a strict interpretation. There is no sense of truly gaining experience \u2013 which I would define as venturing off into unknown lands or slowly flying into a warm front and generally poor weather. These are skills that can only be built by slowly and safely pushing the envelope and boundaries of your own comfort level. Additionally, some other key notes from her presentation included not being reliant on the technology (as we always hear\u2026.) and flying in all different types of scenarios, to help you learn and adjust to unknown situations.</p> <p>After lunch the afternoon seminar focused on a presentation concerning Basic Med. An update regarding my medical status will be thoroughly documented in another post, soon to come!</p>"},{"location":"posts/24_cross_pond_2018/","title":"Cross the Pond 2018 - Westbound","text":"<p>As I was mentioning in my previous post, I signed up to participate in the bi-annual CTP event hosted by VATSIM UK. These events are always scheduled to occur around April and October; with one flight tracking westward and the other flight tracking eastward. The April flight tracks westward. I received my routing the evening before so I could begin to dissect it and take into consideration alternate airports for emergency scenarios. I always fly the PMDG777 with random failures turned ON. It adds a good bit of realism to the whole experience, even if it would possibly mean you not being able to arrive at your final destination. I have yet to experience any sort of significant failure, however.</p> <p>My initial flight routing between EPWA and KORD was as follows:</p> <p>OLILA L621 ROE M743 ALM L975 BAVTA L983 PETIL L983 GOW DCT MIMKU DCT PIKIL 5720N 5830N 5840N 5750N HOIST N604B YMT SSM TVC WYNDE8</p> <p>With Track A across the Atlantic. The NAT track portion of the flight route begins at PIKIL and ends at HOIST. My CTOT (Confirmed Take Off Time) was at 12:22Z, and I connected to VATSIM at EPWA at Gate 45 approximately 45 minutes before the scheduled departure. I fired up a Cold &amp; Dark scenario and begun making the planning preparations for the flight. To begin, these were my weights:</p> <p></p> <p>My ZFW was 422.8 and for the planned 9:28 minute flight, I\u2019ll need approximately 150,288 pounds of fuel. The actual flight time ended up being just a few minutes more, at 9:36 minutes. I had MSN as an alternate airfield which required alternate fuel requirements of 5,822 pounds. As preparations were being made for the Atlantic voyage \u2013 the fuelers were busy pumping the 171,000 pounds of JET-A required for the flight. PMDG has done an excellent job simulating fueling operations for the 777. Upon calling EPWA Delivery for our clearance, which was precisely the same route as what was given to us via e-mail the night before, we were additionally cleared for the OLILA6G departure with an initial altitude restriction of 6,000 feet. We began taxi for the departure runway 29 approximately 12:15Z, and arriving in the hold short queue as number 7ish for departure:</p> <p></p> <p>Unfortunately, I do not have a fancy AI package and so all aircraft were appearing as narrowbody CRJ\u2019s. I had also purchased a subscription to Navigraph for the event, so I can track my aircraft position in real time on all the different charts I\u2019ll be utilizing throughout the course of the flight. My queue in the hold short line appeared as so:</p> <p></p> <p>I\u2019m the purple icon right near the E2 designator on the chart. After fifteen minutes of waiting, we were finally cleared onto the runway (note the OLILA6G SID loaded on the ND and WXR activated for the distant TCU\u2019s):</p> <p></p> <p>The departure on the chart looked as follows, though we did not follow the SID star all the way through, we were given at least two DCT waypoints shortly after clearing FL120:</p> <p></p> <p>I climbed for my initial clearance altitude at FL and was handed over to Warsaw Radar, and thereafter Swedish Radar and Copenhagen, etc. The flight through Europe was smooth, and the only hiccup I encountered was with my own aircraft; the vertical navigation profile for my flight was unavailable, and I lost all ETA and fuel predictions as well as altitude constraints throughout the duration of the flight. It did not pose as much of a problem as I originally anticipated, and I continued the flight without any other significant complications.</p> <p> </p> <p>The flight on NAT Track A was uneventful and routine. I had no traffic within my immediate vicinity so spacing restrictions were not so much of an issue for me. Upon maing Landfall, I requested a S/C to FL370 and FL380 and then we were handed over to Gander Domestic and Montreal Center and then Toronto Center, before being handed over to Minneapolis Center who began making prepartions for our arrival into ORD. The weather we were expecting was going to make the approach challenging, with the following TAF outlining our expectations of arrival into ORD:</p> <p></p> <p>Our arrival was scheduled for approximately 22:00Z or so, we were looking at winds 06023G33KT and 4SM visibility with an overcast layer at OVC005. Low IFR conditions for sure. The weather radar WYNDE8 arrival looked as follows:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As we were snaking our way towards ORD on the WYNDE8.SSM.10L arrival, i was following along on the Navigraph app to ensure all crossing restrictions were consistent with ATC expectations:</p> <p></p> <p>Right as we hit the shoreline to Chicago, we were then handed over a couple of more times through the various Chicago Approach frequencies and eventually were given vectors from TUBEZ, heading 180, thereafter heading 270, thereafter heading 060 to intercept the 10L localizer. After reviewing the approach plate for the ILS/LOC 10L into KORD, I dialed in the various radio aids and minimums settings and quickly briefed the approach. It\u2019s much harder to perform all this under single pilot operations! After entering the clouds at 8,100 MSL, we didn\u2019t break out until a minute or so before landing! Unbelievable! Here we were at 1,600 MSL with another 800 feet to go to minimums with no runway in sight.</p> <p></p> <p>Shortly thereafter, at 1,100 MSL we saw the ALSF-2 lighting into 10L, and the autopilot was disconnected for a manual landing:</p> <p></p> <p>At this point, a quick verification between the ORD METAR showing OVC005 and my altimeter, where ORD elevation is ~700 Feet, 700 + 500 = 1,200 MSL. The METARs were spot on with the weather depicted! AS2016 does a great job of simulating weather.</p> <p>Overall, my impressions on this cross the pond were as follows:</p> <ul> <li>A big thanks to all participating ATC facilities. Warsaw was hands down the smoothest departure airport I have ever flown out of. Everyone was professional, courteous, and the staff was competent. The WORST experience I ever had was at KIAD, where i sat at the gate for three hours waiting to get my clearance for departure. It got to the point where people were just disconnecting and flying out and re-connecting once airborne.</li> <li>Chicago O\u2019Hare was a great experience flying into. In the past, I have had a couple of difficult encounters flying into ORD, mostly in the form of missed descent instructions and blown ILS approaches with bad vectoring/spacing. Luckily, this time everyone was on top of their game. A great experience flying into ORD with MIFR weather.</li> <li>Active Sky 2016 does a phenomenal job of recreating weather. Sitting by the controls for this entire long haul flight, I was able to see the various weather systems come and go, with no significant \u201cpopping\u201d of clouds at any point.     P3Dv4 is an incredibly stable platform for flight simming. 64-bit was really a god send for the PC aviation community, I no longer experience any random CTD\u2019s or any other issues that I used to be absolutely terrified of during CTP.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"posts/25_piper_arrow/","title":"Piper Arrow & Other News","text":"<p>A slow day at work has me contemplating what else I\u2019d like to accomplish during my flying season this year. The goals are rather straight-forward and will be outlined point by point:</p> <p>Piper Arrow Check ride/Complex Rating \u2013  Our club offers members the opportunity to fly three different aircraft, one of which is the \u201ccomplex\u201d Piper Arrow. It\u2019s not necessarily that I am jumping at the opportunity to fly this aircraft, however, due to me serving as a hopeful safety pilot during the second half of this year, I\u2019d like to broaden the range of aircraft available to me for scheduling, as our club has grown quite a bit in the recent months (more than 60 active members disbursed among three club aircraft). The Arrow aircraft is outfitted with an Aspen PFD/ND display, along with at least one GPS430 unit. The technology is streamlined with our other aircraft, so from that perspective, it should not be difficult to adjust. However, having extending gear and a constant propeller does add to the intricacies of flying this particular aircraft more than the technology.</p> <p>For instance, with retractable gear, you must now introduce an entire new electrical or hydraulic system to bring the gear up and down, which complicates the aircraft integrity. Additionally, a constant prop adds in a new variable to control during the various stages of flight. These are all things I will need to work on when I begin to fly this airplane.</p> <p>More XC time building \u2013 I need to log hours as XC PIC to fulfill requirements of the IR license, and, in general, to become a more competent pilot in general. XC time will allow me to build up the experience I so very much need in order to become a better pilot, there is no short cut around obtaining this experience. A simulator will only take you so far.</p> <p>IR \u201cUnder the Hood\u201d work \u2013 I need to log hours under the hood, flying by the instruments, and concentrating on building good and positive habits related to these aspects of flying.</p>"},{"location":"posts/26_airplane_shopping/","title":"Airplane Shopping","text":"<p>I was never one to dive into the minutia related aspects of acquiring an aircraft. Especially an aircraft that would serve our vast and varied membership profile. We\u2019ve got folks utilizing our aircraft for diverse missions, whether that\u2019d be training and proficiency, sight-seeing around the local area, or packing up their family and flying out of state for several days. Each of these missions would theoretically require a slightly different aircraft, perhaps one with larger fuel tanks, another with a higher useful load, and another with more power under the hood to get the family at their final destination in a more efficient manner than driving a car. The club board would need to synthesize all the varied opinions and information gleaned from focus groups, and come up with a recommended two to three aircraft to further pursue. These focus groups have already been held, and the findings have revealed to a certain degree, consistency in recommending the following aircraft to add to the ranks of our flying club:</p> <pre><code>Cirrus SR-20 (G1/G2)\nDiamond DA-40\nCessna C-182\n</code></pre> <p>Of the three aircraft, the remainder of this post will discuss the first bullet-point: the Cirrus SR-20.</p> <p>Cirrus began producing aircraft, or, at least the SR-20 around 1999. Several variations of this aircraft have been produced, including the G1 (1999-2003), G2 (2004-2007) and G6 (current) series. As a club, we\u2019re focusing on the line of Cirrus SR-20 that are either G1 or G2, with a six-pack main instrument display and a price tag &lt; $160,000. It\u2019s easy to find a newer Cirrus aircraft with a price tag greater than $200,000. So what led the club, and particularly me, to like the Cirrus aircraft? Some things include:</p> <pre><code>Doors on both sides \u2013 and the manner in which they open.\nCirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS)\nCruising speed of ~155 KIAS\nA healthy useful load\nA sleek, low-wing aircraft\nA roomy, much larger interior than what I\u2019m accustomed to\nA similar fuel-burn profile to other aircraft\n</code></pre> <p>The aerodynamics of the aircraft no doubt add to the sleekness and faster cruising speed for the SR-20. It\u2019s an aircraft designed to be flown greater distances and not just utilized for pattern work such as a Cessna 172 or Piper Warrior. For primary training, such an aircraft would make little sense to a student studying for their PPL. Given that our flying club does serve to pilots looking to obtain their wings, an aircraft purchase such as an SR-20 would likely not mean much for the rookie pilot looking to accumulate hours.</p> <p>My next blog post will dive into the specifics regarding acquiring a DA-40 aircraft.</p>"},{"location":"posts/27_trip_3dt/","title":"Trip Report - 3DT Ephraim","text":"<p>In my younger years, I was always skeptical of airport codes containing a mixture of letters and numbers. I thought these are locations not worth landing in, as the runways were probably grass and the services provided would be minimal and useless. Even more so in the Fall. This flight changed my perceptions indefinitely.</p> <p>With winter fast approaching and I in need of more XC PIC and simulated IFR time, I thought it would be a great idea to invite my friend Tomek from the flying club to plan a day trip with me up north, to Door County, Wisconsin. I\u2019ve never been to this part of Wisconsin, but the people I have spoken with all had positive things to say. Given that the distance is just over 200NM each way, I thought it would be a great way to log some quality XC time and perhaps dive a little more into the intricacies concerning the usage of the GNS430. Some goals I had set for myself included:</p> <pre><code>Become more used to flying longer distances away from home base.\nLearning more about the GPS and navigation capabilities of the GNS430 in conjunction with the Aspen EFD1000.\nDeveloping proper IFR instrument scans and leveraging the AP so that I can better manage the flight.\n</code></pre> <p>Some things that did not quite work out as I had hoped regarding the flight included:</p> <pre><code>Knowing my fuel burn figures and estimated times to complete each of my planned legs. This was lost in the GPS planning.\nUnderstanding altitude constraints as they are applicable to setting up for an IAP at any given destination airport. Also, relevant checklists before commencing an IAP into an unfamiliar airport (more on this later).\n</code></pre> <p>The day began uneventfully with a wake-up at 7AM to make it for the pre-flight of our Piper Archer by 0900. With weather forecast as VFR for the duration of the day, I knew we would not an issue to make a go/no-go decision. Before hand, Tomek and I agreed that I would fly the leg, mostly under simulated IMC to 3D2. Tomek would captain the return leg. The planned routing for my sector is portrayed below:</p> <p></p> <p>The green dots all around indicate favorable VFR weather conditions. Most of the flight was planned over terrain, in the rural parts of Illinois and Wisconsin. I specifically selected VOR and waypoints as much as possible to maximize my ability to create a legitimate flight plan in the 430. Wheels up time was approximately 1030, with an initial cruising altitude of 3,000 feet climbing 7,500 after we clear the Bravo shelf. I picked up flight following from Milwaukee Approach when we were 15 to the west, and utilized that feature until approximately SUE, where we disconnected to make preparations for the IAP RNAV 32 into 3D2. Flight following was a great asset to the flight, even though we barely received any advisories because of the low level of traffic in the area. We additionally were ADS-B equipped so traffic advisories appeared on our IPads.</p> <p>Much of the flight was uneventful, save for the fuel pressure indication that was almost at 0 during the climb phase to 7,500. This was the highest altitude I have ever personally flown at, so I was initially not so suspicious about the indication as Tomek was. Leveling the aircraft off, the gauge picked up, but turning the electrical auxiliary fuel pump ON made the needle jump even more. I figured the supplemental fuel pump can help us in case the engine driven fuel pump was not producing enough power for the flight. There was no hesitancy from the engine whatsoever, and that weighed into my calculations as well. Throughout a majority of the flight, there was not much to see visually, so it was refreshing for me to be able to concentrate fully on the instruments to log the necessary simulated IMC for my instrument rating. Tomek did a good job scanning for traffic, but on an October Monday morning, there did not seem to be much in the air within these regions of rural Wisconsin. He provided me w its a lot of useful insights concerning the programming and execution of various bits concerning the 430.</p> <p></p> <p>The winds at the destination were variable, anywhere from 190 to 260 at around 8 knots with infrequent gusts to about 13 knots. This probably did not cause as much concern for me as it should have \u2013 the landing was a bit rough to say the least. I elected for the paved runway which was short, narrow, and sporting a healthy cross-wind as well. If the crosswind component was exceeding 12 knots or so, I think I would have elected for the grass strip at the airport. Around SUE, I began making the mental calculations to ensure we cleared AQECY at 2,500. A picture of the procedure I was setting up for is referenced below:</p> <p></p> <p>This is where the flight became the most beneficial for me. Tomek, is very proficient at instrument flight, he was able to provide me with all his knowledge thus far regarding the proper execution of such an RNAV approach. We first conducted an approach briefing where we reviewed the critical pieces concerning this chart, such things as:</p> <ul> <li>The procedure itself, coded and verified against the waypoints selected for the IAP in the 430.</li> <li>Applicable minimum descent altitudes</li> <li>Applicable step down fixes and mandatory altitude requirements</li> <li>Maintaining the applicable speed during each phase of the approach (IAF, IF and FAF)</li> <li>Running through an assortment of checklists to ensure everything is prepared: PIKE, GUMPS, 5 T\u2019s</li> <li>Discussing the holding procedure if we would have gone missed</li> </ul> <p>For the most part, the approach was conducted well with particular emphasis I need to place on further training for the following aspects:</p> <ul> <li>Speed control</li> <li>Land/Go Around decision making</li> <li>Taxi after landing information</li> </ul> <p>It was a difficult landing for me, particularly because I am used to urban runway environments offering 8,000 feet and 150 feet width. For this runway, I had approximately 2600 feet and 60 feet with a moderate cross wind! The winds were quite gusty on approach, which resulted in a bounce on landing. I should have realized the speed situation a little earlier on and conducted a go around. Nevertheless, we did get down, taxied to the general apron area and shut down. We deplaned in an effort to find some staff but the FBO was closed until Friday. Luckily, there was plenty of posted signage with phone numbers to contact airport staff, with the result of us being given the opportunity to use the airport van to do some sight seeing in the area for several hours! Additionally, there were bikes available to use as well, and we treated this transportation option as a fail-safe in case we could not gain access to the vehicle.</p> <p>Exploring the city of Ephraim and Fish Creek was exciting \u2013 this is the perfect time of the year to plan such travels. The Fall foliage combined with the off season really makes the local scene relaxed, mellow, and feeling a bit abandoned. It was great for a day trip. Peninsula State Park was a treasure to behold, with beautiful sights all around. Some of these pictures will be uploaded and shared on this blog.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"posts/28_fleet_growth/","title":"Fleet Growth","text":"<p>As of about one week ago, our club acquired a fourth airplane to help offset club growth and give club members more flexibility in the type of aircraft they are able to rent. The process of purchasing a new airplane extended over approximately two years. The process first began with focus group meetings broken down across annual pilot flying hours. It would of course, make the most sense to create these types of groups because pilots who produce more income for the club are naturally going to be the ones flying any new airplane more frequently. A pilot flying 1 hour annually should not overshadow the voice of a pilot who flies demonstratably more.</p> <p>Groups were assigned, feedback was generated and thoughts were organized into new aircraft options. These were: Diamond DA-40, Cirrus SR-20 and a Cessna 182. We elected to focus our efforts on the Cirrus SR-20. We used a pre-buy moderator called Savvy, who provide some of the front-end maintenance checks before we commit to the purchase of an aircraft. For anyone not familiar with the process, a pre-buy is an essential ingredient to ensuring you don\u2019t purchase something you will regret down the line. A pre-buy takes the aircraft through it\u2019s paces, running things like oil samples, airframe checks, airworthiness directives, etc. It ensures the aircraft has been in compliance with all the maintenace work required of it.</p> <p>Two aircraft were found for potential purchase, both were type Cirrus SR-20. The second one, N700ZG, was based in South Carolina with a motivated seller. This is the airplane we purchased.</p> <p>From an equipment standpoint, the SR-20 comes equipped with a lot of technology I have had no prior experience using. This includes an Avidyne Entegra EX5000C, a completely new primary flight display, a parachute deployment system for emergencies, and a Garmin GMA 320 (a lesser version of the infamous 340 unit). Additionally, the Avidyne MFD packs a lot of data including digital engine monitoring, moving maps, and electronic check lists.</p> <p>Structurally, the aircraft packs a punch with a six cyclinder, Continental IO-360-ES fuel injected aircraft. The doors open like a Ferrari, and the cruise speed is somewhere in the range of 150 KTAS. That\u2019s a significant boost-up from the Piper Archer I\u2019m so used to flying.</p> <p>The next post will dive into more of the technical details related to the aircraft, discussing some of the performance differences between the Cirrus SR-20 and the Piper Archer III.</p>"},{"location":"posts/29_ir_training/","title":"Instrument Training","text":"<p>I\u2019ve officially kicked off my training for the FAA instrument rating in the Fall, and have begun flying with an instructor to build the necessary time and experience. Some of this experience includes 50 hours of cross-country time, where I need to fly and land at an airport 50 nautical miles from my origin. The other requirement is to have 40 hours logged in either simulated or actual instrument meteorological conditions. I also need some time flying around with an instructor to build the requisite skills when flying under the hood.</p> <p>At the FAA, the IR is one of the more difficult licenses to obtain, primarily because it introduces the pilot to an entirely new type of flying. In instrument flying, the pilot does not fly by visual reference but instead, by their instrumentation. This changes the flying game entirely, as pilots must now balance a very busy workload managing things inside the flight deck with flying the airplane. Given all the new skills I\u2019ll need to develop, I often enlist the help of fellow club members to come flying with me. This gives me the opportunity to have my flying critiqued, and correct areas of weakness before they build into bad habits. At one of our monthly flying meetings, I met a fellow member, Frank, who just completed his IR and would be willing to come along to critique my flying.</p> <p>On a last-minute whim due to some favorable warm weather and a short work week, we decided to plan a quick cross-country flight to Greater Kankakee airport (KIKK) from KDPA, my home base. The route I planned was:</p> <p>KDPA JOT EON KIKK</p> <p></p> <p>Total flying time was approximately ~ 45 minutes each way. The plan was to touch down at the airport, taxi back and take off again back for KDPA. Before takeoff, I tuned as many of the parameters concerning the flight as I could, including radio frequencies, the expected approach at KIKK (ILS 04) and the various navigation radio facilities along the route (JOT, EON). Frank and I agreed that I\u2019ll be the PF (pilot flying) and he will be my safety pilot in the form of PIC PNF. As there are two crew-members required for this type of flight (one scanning the outside for traffic, the other flying), we are both legally able to log PIC time for the duration of the flight that I am operating under the hood. We took off from RWY 20R at 21:02 CDT.</p> <p>The Piper Archer III is an absolute breeze to fly. I like the low-wing configuration better than a Cessna, and the tank switching every 00:45 minutes makes it a less forgiving airplane, than, a Cessna, where gravity keeps the fuel supply to the engine going. I\u2019ve been focusing all my flying in this single airplane in order to become as comfortable with it as possible, in addition to the avionics which include 1 GPS430W, 1 GPS430, STEC 55X Auto Pilot, ADS-B IN/OUT, and an ASPEN EFD1000. It\u2019s the relationship between the ASPEN EFD and the 430W that I need to pay the most attention to, as these two tools are simply indispensable for a modern IFR flight.</p> <p>During the en-route phase I began setting up for the approach. In instrument flying, the pinnacle of the entire flight rests on the pilot properly flying an approach procedure into an airport that is capable of handling these types of arrivals. Before commencing the approach, the pilot first needs to brief it, based on the chart for that airport and runway. The pilot must always tune, and identify all ground based navigation systems and follow the descent and landing checklists. Here we have the KIKK ILS 04 approach that I was going to fly into the airport: </p> <p></p> <p>Briefing the approach needs to begin from the top of the strip, and working your way down. The first things to note are the Airport, Runway, and localizer approach frequency, 108.7. Next, the final approach course, 038 degrees. Then, our landing distance gives us a good idea about how much length we have for our touch-down and roll-out. Next, we review the pertinent notes. Circling to the opposed 16/34 RWY at night is forbidden, and increases to the decision altitude must be made if certain criteria are met, such as in-operational runway lights or a lack of altimeter setting.</p> <p>As I was planning to begin the approach at the IAF of LUKOW, which also serves as the LOM/IAF, I would be required to do a procedure turn. The orange loop toward the bottom of the picture shows me reversing my course to intercept the localizer for RWY 04. As this is a precision approach, there is no need to brief the various step down fixes associated with the approach, such as the altitude requirement at LUKOW. We must however, throughout the approach and before flying to the FAF, maintain at least an altitude of 2,300 feet until the glide slope intercept altitude, which is 1,900 for this approach. We brief our minimum altitude for the S-ILS-4 in the bottom table for the type of aircraft we are, Category A, and our decision altitude is 824 feet MSL with a requirement of 1/2 SM forward visibility.</p> <p>Finally, the briefing then goes into the missed approach procedure. What happens if we get down to 824 feet, and don\u2019t see the runway? Legally, we must execute a missed approach. This means we\u2019ll need to fly up and away from the airport, and enter a holding pattern to then decide what we\u2019d like to do next. This is document in the top right hand side of the briefing chart, all caps MISSED APPROACH. In this instance, we\u2019d climb back up to 2,300 feet, then turn right and fly direct to the IKK VOR and enter a holding pattern.</p> <p>I flew the approach exactly in this manner, flying DCT to LUKOW, and then tracking 218 degrees outbound from it while using the GPS 430W to drive the navigation. Then, after about 4NM from LUKOW I began my turn inbound, and meanwhile, switched my CDI from GPS to VLOC, in order to bind the GPS430W to the ground based navigation. At 2NM from the FAF, I slowed to 90 KIAS, and intercepted the glide slope. At this point, it was quite a battle to maintain the glide slope and localizer so most of my energy was going towards maintaining a stable approach. After going visual, I deployed flaps and landed, taxied back and took off towards the southwest on runway 22.</p> <p>The flight back was similar, though this time we were flying back north to KDPA in order to intercept the FAF for the 20R approach. We didn\u2019t want to fly all the way up north to the IAF, as that would add quite a lot of time onto the flight just to track the course southbound again. This approach was again, difficult, given the complexity of all the pieces involved. But with practice, I will need to habitualize all the actions that need to happen so that I can spend time focusing on flying the airplane, and not spending my time trying to remember what I need to do at a certain stage of the flight. Practice makes perfect. My next flight will be an IFR flight from KDPA to KRFD, and shooting the back-course LOC RWY 19 approach.</p>"},{"location":"posts/30_ir_know_test/","title":"Instrument Knowledge Test","text":"<p>Yesterday I sat my IRA knowledge test at Illinois Aviation Academy at KDPA, my home airport. The number of questions was sixty, and the time limit was 180 minutes. My approach to preparing for this examination consisted of several solid months of study. I leveraged the test-question item bank provided by Dauntless Aviation, as I find the explanations provided for the questions to be phenomenal. I reviewed the questions from the item bank, approximately 1,200 of them, for a period of about six months preceding the actual examination. Overkill, I know, but at least this made me feel much more comfortable on the day of the examination.</p> <p>Additionally, I leveraged a lot of the preparatory materials provided by the FAA, such as the Instrument Procedures Handbook, the Instrument Flying Handbook, and the Advisory Circular concerning weather.

As I understand it, we are designated as a non-essential business in the state of Illinois, which brings along a variety of limitations, including no flying. As the state begins to open back up, the limitations placed upon our club continue to be relaxed. At the time of this writing, we are allowed to fly while wearing face masks, ensure we keep social distancing with one another, and follow close protocol concerning the cleaning and decontaminating of airplanes before and after any flight.</p> <p>Given that I haven\u2019t been up in a while, I was eager to get flying again and wrap up my \u201ctype\u201d training for the Cirrus SR-20 our flying club recently acquired. I had about three flights in the airplane, and needed one more to get signed off to fly it solo, but that never happened. My flight instructor may not believe they will return for this flying season and so I\u2019ll have to find another one, in order to wrap up my Cirrus training and instrument rating.</p> <p>Yesterday, 6/18, my friend Tomasz called me up at the last minute and asked if I was interested in going up with him. The plan was going to be a few takeoffs and landings at KDKB, along with two approaches and a holding pattern using the SR-55 A/P. I happily obliged as I have not been up for a long time and felt my skills beginning to erode and get rusty, plus it was a good excuse to just get out of the house and get moving again. We agreed to meet at the hangs at 17:00. A very thorough pre-flight followed, checking such things as:</p> <p></p> <p>Each main landing gear wheel has a brake wear sticker affixed to it. The brake wear sticker, if black, specifies that the brakes were overheated during landing/taxi and should be inspected. Light grey means your good to go. </p> <p></p> <p>Oil is another area of common inspection. The dipstick was indicating 6 quarts, so we decided to add a quart of oil to bring the total up to 7 quarts, which sits right in the middle between the minimum, 6 quarts, and the maximum, 8 quarts.</p> <p>Of course we checked a plethora of other things on the airplane as well, these just happen to be two elements I happened to snap a picture of during pre-flight. Some other photos:</p> <p> </p> <p>We pulled the airplane out and into the alley:</p> <p></p> <p>We next focused on configuring the avionics, headsets, and routing. We checked the applicable weather, NOTAMs, TFRs, and any restrictions that would pose an issue to the flight we were aiming to complete for the day. The plan was to fly to KDKB to execute the RNAV GPS 27 instrument procedure, discontinuing the approach at DA and flying straight to the holding pattern. Afterward, several takeoffs and landings were in order to get a feel for the airplane and it\u2019s landing and takeoff capabilities in different types of configurations.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see KDKB loaded in GPS1 on the bottom of the screen, the engine is stabilized and running, and we have just obtained Information Charlie, specifying weather with ceilings &gt; 5,000 feet and visibility &gt; 5 SM. Winds were 100/09. We taxied for RWY10 with E F, and took off shortly thereafter.</p> <p>After takeoff, we continuously had the ALT2 indication steady on. </p> <p></p> <p>ALT2 indication steady ON.</p> <p>Now, we understand that ALT2 is triggered to come online at RPM\u2019s of around 1,700 or greater. However, we were at full takeoff power for several minutes and the light continued to be on. We therefore references in the abnormal checklist in the MFD to troubleshoot the issue. The steps were quite simple, ALT2 master switch OFF, ALT2 circuit breaker reset, ALT2 master switch ON. If the light continued, we should unload any unnecessary electrical features and land immediately. This is precisely what we did. We wrapped around and landed back on Runway 10 with no incident.</p> <p>Sometimes, plans just don\u2019t work out. In aviation, it\u2019s critical to not push forward when you feel uncomfortable or ought not to. In this case, the ALT2 would not have probably played a significant role in any sort of catastrophic incident as ALT1 seemed to be running reliabily still, but such chances should not be taken.</p>"},{"location":"posts/32_sunrise_flight/","title":"Sunrise Flight","text":"<p>I discontinued my instrument rating training in November, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time.

As we are in the peak of summer, sunrise is at approximately 05:30. We therefore agreed to meet at the hangar at 04:30 where I was going to be PF for the first leg. The weather was going to be another beautiful day, with patches of mist and fog spread cross northwest Indiana, where I intended to fly an IAP into KVPZ, Valparaiso. The flight was quite the thrill, as there was nearly nobody in the air or on the airport at this time, and the sun was slowly starting to climb while temperatures were still relatively cool. We preflighted, requested full fuel and shot off Runway 10 at 05:19 local time.</p> <p>Tomasz encouraged me to fly the Eisenhower transition which I never did before. My version of Foreflight did not have I290 depicted, so we visually stayed clear of the Class-B and Class-C airspace while peeling our eyes to find the highway. We flew at 1,800 feet MSL the entire duration, and contacted Midway Tower to let them know we were monitoring their frequency for traffic or any other important notifications. They did not assign us a squawk code on our eastward journey, but did when flying back westward toward DPA. Likely because of the traffic loads. After reaching the downtown area, we did a circular flight around the area and proceeded southeast DCT KVPZ, transitioning through KGYY airspace. Pictures:</p> <p> </p> <p>Once exiting, we were relatively close to the destination and so I loaded the RNAV GPS RWY 09 approach into the 430W and set up my approach plate and began briefing the approach. A helpful mnemonic here is PICA:</p> <p>P: Procedure</p> <p>I: Inspect IAP waypoints</p> <p>C: CDI selection GPS or VLOC</p> <p>A: Autopilot roll modes during the approach</p> <p>Tomasz advised I fly the procedure turn for training purposes and I agreed. Approach plate:</p> <p></p> <p>Key pieces during the briefing include Final Approach Course, landing runway length, missed approach procedure, frequencies, LPV DA, and minimum altitudes for the various sectors and quadrants.</p> <p>I therefore flew direct FLABE, at 2,800 MSL with the STEC55X in NAV mode. Once reaching the waypoint I switched the roll mode to Heading mode and selected 272 as the outbound course. As this was a direct entry (coming from a magnetic heading of 130), we didn\u2019t have to fly any special procedure with joining the procedure turn. Once I flew heading 272 for 4NM, I switched the 430W to OBS mode and dialed in 092 for the CRS, to fly inbound the holding fix, FLABE. This completed the procedure turn and I could then sequence DCT OCAVE to the FAF and call GUMPS for my pre-landing checklist. The GUMPS checklist stands for:</p> <p>G: Fuel tank switching</p> <p>U: Undercarriage</p> <p>M: Mixture</p> <p>P: Propeller</p> <p>S: Seat belts and switches (lights, pitot heat, etc.)</p> <p>The 430W was picking up the LPV signal so DA was established at 1038 with 1SM visibility. AWOS was reporting 4SM with haze, and sure enough, this photo was snapped 3 minutes before touchdown:</p> <p></p> <p>Towards the end I lost the glideslope a little bit as I was fixated on tracking the localizer. Nevertheless, we broke out of the fog and I was able to see the runway and visually land without incident. We arrived at the FBO and debarked for a debriefing on how to properly enter holding patterns and Tomasz took over for his leg of the flight. This included an RNAV approach at 05C and then heading back to base.</p>"},{"location":"posts/33_ir_xc/","title":"Instrument XC Flight","text":"<p>Yesterday, my instructor and I planned to complete the long cross country portion for the instrument rating Part 61 requirements. The original plan was to fly KDPA -&gt; C15 -&gt; KDVN -&gt; KDPA. However, upon further research, it was determined that we didn\u2019t actually have to fly to three different airports.</p> <p></p> <p>We therefore shifted our flight plan several times until we finally arrived at flying down to KVLA for the VOR/DME 18 approach which included an ARC. VOR/DME ARC approaches are quite rare in the Midwest, so in order to get the experience of flying it we planned to fly to Vandalia.</p> <p>I filed the flight plan through ForeFlight, which is neat because you get messages relayed back to you that may give you revised routing instructions, or any other restrictions or changes to your flight plan that have occurred since filing. The briefing portion of ForeFlight is additionally fantastic. It walks you through, page by page, an articulate summary of your entire route of flight. Reviewing things such as NOTAMs, weather, airport information, and TFRs.</p> <p>We filed for 8,000, which we got. Departure was uneventful. I was given a variety of level-offs before reaching our final cruise altitude, which is to be expected when flying under the shelf of a Class B. I believe they were 3000, 4000, 5000 and 8000 for the altitudes. Throughout the course of the entire flight, I was continually left of course, the aircraft was continually turning to the left at a slight rate. My instructor pointed this out to me several times, and I tried to correct it as much as possible. We worked some rudder trim settings which seemed to help with the issue. My altitude tracking on this first leg was average as well, there were slight deviations. If my instructor hounded me for anything, it was the absolute criticality of nailing down basic attitude flying. Setting and trimming the airplane to a state where you can literally fly hands off in no-turbulence weather and not have to worry too much about the airplane going too much off course. Of course, in the real world we\u2019d be using the STEC55X for navigation guidance, so we likely wouldn\u2019t even be hand flying a 360NM flight. However, during training, it\u2019s best to leave the tech gadgets off and focus on the basic elements of instrument flying.</p> <p>The flight at altitude really was uneventful. We had some frequency changes along the route, which I did not write down but instead plugged directly into the GPS430 COMM frequency box. This was probably not the best way of handling this issue, however, I found it quite effective and quick to get right over to the next frequency and report.</p> <p>As we started getting in closer to our destination, we had two different navigation based approaches we were looking to shoot. Kansas City Center was very accommodating with our requests. The first was the VOR/DME 18 ARC, which terminated with a missed procedure into a hold, where we\u2019d then obtain vectors for the straight in RNAV GPS 18 terminating in a full stop landing.</p> <p>Approach 1: VOR/DME 18</p> <p>This approach was pretty nutty. First of all, our GPS430 gave us the STEEP TURN AHEAD warning in the message box when we were flying towards UFJUV, the IAF for the DME ARC. I descended down to 2,300 and performed a left hand turn at 30 degrees bank to intercept the DME ARC and fly it at 7NM. The lateral limits there is +/- 1NM on either side. Therefore, if during the ARC I was at 6.84, I\u2019d still be .84NM away from the protected area to the left of the ARC. I followed this ARC through to the IF, as seen below:</p> <p></p> <p>The IF was OPUHY, where a turn to the final approach course of 179 degrees magnetic was required. You then follow this to the FAF (VLA). Once crossing the FAF you are allowed to descend down to 1140 MSL where you\u2019ll be at the MDA and in a position to make a landing, remember, three things need to occur for you to make the landing and go under the MDA:</p> <ul> <li>In a position from where you are able to make a safe landing from</li> <li>The required flight visibility is acquired, 1SM in this case.</li> <li>Any of the 14 or so ground-based reference points have been acquired.</li> </ul> <p>I went missed at the MAP, which was WOBVI at 5.8 DME from VLA. This is basically directly above the threshold of RWY 18. I then executed the published missed approach and flew direct VLA for the hold, with a parallel entry. The hold did not last long before vectors were given straight for the IAF associated with the RNAV GPS.</p> <p>Approach 2: RNAV GPS 18</p> <p>The RNAV GPS approach was more straightforward than the VOR/DME approach before. It was again, an LNAV only approach with +V for vertical guidance (advisory in nature). My course corrections were quite significant on this approach, and it was not a great approach. I flew it down to the MDA and went visual at the VDP. I landed and we taxied to get fuel and head back home to DPA. However, the fuel tank was broken and we unfortunately had to fly over to 2H0 for fuel and head back home IFR to KDPA.</p> <p>The final flight back home was at 5,000 feet, a very smooth and calm night. I was able to trim the aircraft out almost perfectly. It required little to no attention to stay on course. During this leg, ATC came on with an amendment to my routing and advised when I was ready to copy. I told them ready to copy and they gave me the waypoint PLANO instead of JOT to make it a more direct flight. We requested and got the ILS/LOC 02L at KDPA with vectors to final. I flew this approach quite well, with little vertical oscillations but more so lateral oscillations. I got out of the hood right at DA and the runway was right in front of me and I was in a good position to land.</p> <p>Things I took away from this flight:</p> <ul> <li>Blue diamond on the green course needle on the Aspen EFD to stay on track.</li> <li>De-clutter your display units as necessary!</li> <li>Maintain small changes to your heading/course, and continually make small corrections.</li> <li>The quicker you trim the airplane out, the better you\u2019ll be on the overall quality of maintaining your DTK.</li> </ul> <p>I logged 5.2 HOBBS on this flight, which will almost get me to where I need to be for check-ride ready status. I have some more work to do with instrument approaches, flying a bunch of them back to back to get me checkride ready. But other then that, I\u2019m looking to be in good shape for it!</p>"},{"location":"posts/34_summer_sched/","title":"Summer 2020 Schedule","text":"<p>I\u2019ve been able to do quite a bit of flying this year for a change. I have logged three particularly fun flights in the last several weeks:</p> <ul> <li>On 9/7/20, Tomasz invited me to fly with him to Poplar Grove, to visit and relate to some of the history of the airport, but also, to fly a yellow 1946 Piper Cub with him! It was exhilarating, to fly an airplane with no electrical system and a couple of gauges and a stick. He let me have the airplane and control for at least thirty minutes, unloggable of course, as I do not have my tail wheel endorsement. This was probably the most fun flight I have had all year long.</li> <li>Second flight was my first actual IMC/IFR flight with Terry. We filed DPA-DKB-DPA. Terry flew the DPA-DKB leg, and I flew back, the DKB-DPA leg. We were straight IMC the whole way through, and I was given the ILS 02L approach into DPA. I did a great job, with just some work I\u2019ll need to focus on in the future to correct my heading corrections when flying a cross-wind, as I was swinging wildly on the localizer for the approach. My vertical guidance however was spot on.</li> <li>My last flight was with Gary, to get my checkout (finally) in the SR-20. It worked out great and I was checked out after only a single flight! I have already made plans to take a few friends on 10/8/20 for a trip.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"posts/35_new_dawn/","title":"Flying Update","text":"<p>Since I've returned from a week-long trip to Brasil with my wife, I've had the sudden urge to start to wrap things up with my flying. These activities have already kicked off since I returned in March, where I've logged more time in my logbook than I have over the course of the last two years. One particular early win I've accomplished this year already is my complex rating. I was able to secure that with four flights, totalling about 11.4 hours of tach time on our club's Piper Arrow III. The aircraft is great to fly, and with the extra long endurance fuel tanks, something you can take along for quite long flying trips cross country. In the event that all the other club airplanes are booked, I can see myself using the Arrow III for my flight needs.</p> <p>The next point that I'd like to turn my attention to is wrapping up my Instrument Rating. As the readers of my blog will know, I've spent considerable time circa ~ 2020 attempting to wrap up my IR, but personal life got into the way and I had to abandon flying for a couple of years. I'm back now, and completely refreshed. I've taken the written and scored a 95%. The only portion of the test that now remains includes the oral and the check ride. As I plan to complete this checkride in southern Wisconsin, I'll have to spend some time, both in the simulator and in real life, visiting and shooting a few \"odd\" IAPs around the airports, such as the C44 VOR-A and the JVL ILS/DME ARC 4 approaches. I believe these may come up on the checkride, so I need to be completely prepared to better understand how to program and fly them, whether they will be flown with Autopilot or not remains to be seen.</p> <p>I'm currently slotted to take the checkride at some point in June. Thereafter I intend to jump directly into wrapping up my Commercial rating as well, since I already meet the minimum requirements for the CPL from an hours perspective (you need 250, of which I have 247.5 upon completing this post).</p> <p>I've got one or two more flights with my instructor before I get the sign off for the checkride - which I hope will happen sometime mid-month. After that, it's cramming for the oral a bit more and I'll be off to the races.</p>"},{"location":"posts/36_siop2025/","title":"SIOP 2025 Conference","text":"<p>As has been my routine for the last several years, I attended the annual Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology conference in Denver. The purpose is two-fold: networking and learning. On the points regarding learning, I can say that I've learned a few new techniques that could prove valuable:</p> <p>Learnings:</p> <ul> <li>Social Network Analyses, or SNA for short, have to do with the graph capability of networking to provide useful information concerning some business-related phenomena. This could be anything ranging from job movement, to visualizing an organizational hierarchy, to mapping the e-mail patterns of the corporate executive team. It's surprising to me that SNA is not being leaned into more at SIOP, especially concerning that SNA can effectively model communication patterns and solve for rather complex issues such as succession planning.</li> <li>Metrics. You thought us I/O Psychologists have figured it all out with regards to custom metrics, but we are far from that truth. There was a couple presentations on new metrics being constructed at ZScaler concerning time-to-fill for volume hiring, and at Dropbox for answering the business question, \"is SWE talent only available for hire in the Bay area?\". Therefore, the metrics here deal with job performance and hiring times.</li> <li>Another session proposed the idea of letting an LLM serve as a proxy for item-related performance and statistics. There was promising performance utilizing a BERT model for item generation. Everything doesn't always have to require the state of the art performance from the latest and greatest LLM. Let's not forget the tools from the (not so) distant past.</li> <li>Finally, one session was a very hands-on application of building an R shiny app and deploying it to AWS. I've saved the instructions step-by-step, because I have a few currently offline shiny apps that I'd like to upload to my website in order to showcase some previous work. As I work through these pieces, it is becoming more and more necessary for me to learn the basics concerning AWS, as this will serve as my general hosting area for these (and future) projects.</li> </ul> <p>The networking at SIOP simply cannot not be found anywhere else. The energy, enthusiasm and willingness of people to chat makes the event a truly melting pot for ideas across industries, while also bolstering your contact list in general. </p> <p>In the past, I did a bit of volunteering for SIOP and stood up an R Shiny Dashboard for Membership Analytics, however, when mandatory retirement (after 3 years) came around, I hardly had anybody to pass the project (and the enthusiasm) too. Perhaps it's time to revisit the volunteering opportunities at SIOP.</p>"},{"location":"projects/scorify/","title":"Scorify","text":"<p>This is scorify apP!</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p> <p>Yes Yes Yes</p>"},{"location":"archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"archive/2020/","title":"2020","text":""},{"location":"archive/2019/","title":"2019","text":""},{"location":"archive/2018/","title":"2018","text":""},{"location":"archive/2017/","title":"2017","text":""},{"location":"archive/2016/","title":"2016","text":""},{"location":"archive/2015/","title":"2015","text":""},{"location":"category/iopsychology/","title":"IOPsychology","text":""},{"location":"category/programming/","title":"Programming","text":""},{"location":"category/aillm/","title":"AI/LLM","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flight-simulator/","title":"Flight Simulator","text":""},{"location":"category/gear/","title":"Gear","text":""},{"location":"page/2/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/3/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/4/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/5/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/6/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/7/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"archive/2018/page/2/","title":"2018","text":""},{"location":"archive/2017/page/2/","title":"2017","text":""},{"location":"archive/2016/page/2/","title":"2016","text":""},{"location":"archive/2015/page/2/","title":"2015","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/2/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/3/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/4/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/5/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/6/","title":"Flying","text":""},{"location":"category/flying/page/7/","title":"Flying","text":""}]}
